      // For the script to work, you'd need to pass this ID to the component or use context.

      // A more robust way without context is to fetch based on current slug and locale
      // to find the group ID, but that's inefficient.

      // Let's implement the most direct logic assuming we can fetch the group ID
      // This is the ideal logic but requires getting the group ID to the component.

      // Correct approach: Find the translationGroupId based on the current post.
      // Since we can't do that here directly, we'll demonstrate the fetch.
      // A better way is shown in Step 3. For now, we'll simulate a fetch.

      // Final logic: the page will fetch translations and provide them via hreflang.
